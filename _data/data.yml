    summary: |
      Gabrielle Mary Jean-Louis is a PhD student in the Department of English at the University of Miami. Her research focus on contemporary Haitian literary and visual culture explores the ways in which Haitian women creatives present modes of resistance that acts as a counter balance to sexual anxieties rooted in U.S. imperialism and occupation between 1915 and 1934, and then again in 1994. Her critical inquiry also considers these modes of resistance as they occur in the literary landscapes during the father-son Duvalier regime (1957–1986). Her forthcoming essay *A Black Feminist Gaze Haitian Female Artists Reimagining Spiritual Iconography* for the **Perez Art Museum Miami Caribbean Cultural Institute** argues how Haitian female artists render a gaze that disrupts patriarchal dominance and Eurocentric religiosity. She has presented her work at the Modern Language Association Annual Convention and the Caribbean Studies Association Annual Conference.

        company: English Department, University of Miami
        details: |
          As an English 105 instructor, I introduced students to the types of reading, writing, and thinking that occurs in the university community. They were asked to read several essays and to write in ways generated by Caribbean writers, making use of their ideas for their own purposes. In this sense, writing became an act of “thinking on paper,” a constant negotiation and reformulation, a process that involved juggling complicated ideas of their own and of others. The courses functioned as a workshop of sorts, a roundtable of opinion and debate that promoted revision and re-evaluation in writing as well as their thinking.

    summary: |
      Gabrielle Mary Jean-Louis is a PhD student in the Department of English at the University of Miami. Her research focus on contemporary Haitian literary and visual culture explores the ways in which Haitian women creatives present modes of resistance that acts as a counter balance to sexual anxieties rooted in U.S. imperialism and occupation between 1915 and 1934, and then again in 1994. Her critical inquiry also considers these modes of resistance as they occur in the literary landscapes during the father-son Duvalier regime (1957–1986). Her forthcoming essay *A Black Feminist Gaze Haitian Female Artists Reimagining Spiritual Iconography* for the **Perez Art Museum Miami Caribbean Cultural Institute** argues how Haitian female artists render a gaze that disrupts patriarchal dominance and Eurocentric religiosity. She has presented her work at the Modern Language Association Annual Convention and the Caribbean Studies Association Annual Conference.
